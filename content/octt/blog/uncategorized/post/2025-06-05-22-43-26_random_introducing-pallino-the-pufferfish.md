Pallino is a pufferfish (the pufferfish?) that lives mainly on Telegram. This is the case since the man in question, when [the infamous "FishPuffer" sticker pack](https://t.me/addstickers/FishPuffer) was released by the Telegram team years ago, adopted the identity of the "Puffer Fish" portrayed in those colorful animations, and has now fallen permanently into that rabbit hole.

In Italian, his name literally means "small ball", but could also be technically identified with "small dot".
I will refer to him as Palla (literally "ball") in the remainder of this page, because I'm evil. (He doesn't actually hate this nickname, it's just that it obviously makes a different effect on reading it, as it does for me on writing it.)

The Palla has fallen victim to a substantial amount of injustices in his life, including defamation via the Internet more recently. (No, I'm not secretly referring to this post you are just reading, but to other series of incidents that will not be listed here.) While he certainly has his good reasons to complain, please be careful to not blindly trust what he says, since he has been known to exaggerate his situation, unfortunately. He currently finds (bad) excuses every day to be able to continue rotting, remaining without any productive personal occupation.

In case of necessity, the Palla can always be contacted directly on Telegram, at the handle [@DrG95](https://t.me/DrG95). Please do so only if strictly necessary, as he is a fully autonomous, strong and independent fish, living his own life; not a zoo animal. I'm also not leaving his personal phone number, since I don't have it and also his phone is broken, with the microphone not working, so he literally couldn't respond to what you would say.
