When I was very little, and utterly obsessed with creating websites (not developing them, mind you; just using the various free site builders out there to create the strangest and frankly emptiest websites about any given topic), many times I had an epiphany about a website called "PSP Ghetto", where things would have been written as if the PSP was to be glorified in a ghetto setting...

I imagined it as something written by boys in a Brazilian favela, or something of that kind, where they expressed their appreciation for the portable gaming console, and how the thing fostered community in an otherwise rough place... and obviously that wouldn't happen with just any PSP, but only with the most crappy, honestly really ghetto, edition: the PSP street. Which I never had myself, but I have used it from a friend at the time; and, even if my memories are foggy now, I can say for certain that thing feels so incredibly cheap for a Sony product.

Well, I never actually even parked the (free, obvsiouly) subdomain for the site in question, because in practice I had no idea what to put on there besides just a handful of pages. And so, nothing of value was lost, really. However... sometimes, when the PSP Street comes to my mind, this fact comes with it, and this evening I decided to actually try and search for that sequence of words on the web: [🔍 "PSP Ghetto"](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22PSP%20Ghetto%22). And I was actually shocked by what came up.

Apart from a few poorly relevant results, I found [a spam thread on the PSPWorld.com forum](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/pspworld/psp-ghetto-t209.html) (which I never even knew existed, probably because the domain name either never existed or has expired; the thread was archived by Tapatalk), literally titled "PSP Ghetto", where [user Jdoggokussj2](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/pspworld/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=2) advertises a website...

Tonight is really strange, as not only this is the second domain I find in a row that doesn't resolve, but this also has seemingly nothing to do with PSP and ghettos. It has something to do with just a ghetto — the bandit's one, I presume, whatever it is — but not the PSP one. And yet, [looking up the page in question on the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20191205211044/http://banditsghetto.forumcity.com/) yielded a surprising result: the website actually refers to itself as PSPGhetto.

The website is a forum, featuring a small banner image that's interesting to say the least: there are 3 llamas or some similar animal, dressed in "ghetto clothing", with a tilted PSP in the background, and the site's name in the front, repeated with a crusty font that just slightly reminds me of the GTA San Andreas one. Then, we see the most generic tagline ever, and forum sections that go from the ridiculous... to the mildly concerning.

Unfortunately, it seems very hard right now to investigate further, as I should really (really!) shut down my computer and go to sleep given how late it is... and also, very few pages beyond the navigation ones have been archived. Whatever actually lied beyond the gaming facade, though, I'm kinda happy to see that a website named PSP Ghetto actually existed, after all, even if I never actually had the balls—I mean, the ideas—to create it myself... and despite the fact that the PSP Street seems to not be in the picture at all with this one.
