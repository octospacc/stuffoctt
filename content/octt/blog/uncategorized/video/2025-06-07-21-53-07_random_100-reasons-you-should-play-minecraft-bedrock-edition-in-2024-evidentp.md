While browsing YouTube this evening, I randomly got recommended this video, and I got curious. As someone who has always preferred the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft, even something like 8 years ago when that position was almost unheard of, I like seeing reasons explaining the superiority of Bedrock well laid out in a big compilation. Since this specific list is not presented in written form anywhere, though, I figured I'd transcribe and comment it myself.

So, here are [**100 Reasons You Should Play Minecraft Bedrock Edition**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGCddEOVmHo), instead of the Java one, according to EvidentP. The video is from 2024, a year ago, which means that some minor things could have changed since then, but in general everything holds up.

1. **The Hive**: a really nice server, made for Bedrock Edition specifically and well-polished.

2. Hive's **Top Snow**: on The Hive, it's possible to place Snow on top of air to create a trap, where other players can fall trough.

3. Hive's **Fake Ladder Trap**: ladders can be placed on the opposite side of the block, making them a trap for unsuspecting players to fall into a void below.

4. Hive's **Ladder Bridge**: ladders can be placed to create a walkable bridge, which can be collapsed in one go, making it a trap.

5. Hive's **Custom Servers**, ideal for content creators to hang out with fans.

6. **Leads On Boats**: boats can be leashed, meaning they can move with you, thus making it easier to transport mobs using them.

7. **Bonemealing Sugarcane**: sugarcane can be grown instantly using bone meal.

8. **Underwater Redstone**: redstone-related blocks, like repeaters (but not redstone dust), can be placed under water.

9. **Underwater Buttons**: buttons and tripwires can be placed under water, allowing redstone circuits to be activated even down there.

10. **Longer Reach**

11. **Baby Squids**

12. **Baby Dolphins**

13. **Snowy Leaves**

14. **Finding The Stronghold** is easier, since they always spawn under a village.

15. **Pearl At The Dragon**: an Ender Pearl can be used on the Ender Dragon, making it easier to beat (takes less damage / requires less hits).

16. **Frozen Dragon**: due to a glitch, placing a lava block with a specific construction at a certain moment during one of the Ender Dragon's animation makes it freeze in place, stopping it from flying away.

17. **Ticking Area**: a feature to define areas in which redstone and command blocks run even when the chunks aren't loaded.

19. **Border Blocks**

20. **Portal Glitch**
