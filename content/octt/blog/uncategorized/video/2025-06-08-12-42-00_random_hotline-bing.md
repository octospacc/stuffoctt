[Intro]  
You used to read me on my  
You used to, you used to  
Yeah  

[Chorus]  
You used to read me on my web site  
Late-night when you need my posts  
Read me on my web site  
Late-night when you need my posts  
And I know when that hotline Bing  
That can only mean one thing  
I know when that hotline Bing  
That can only mean one thing  

[Verse 1]  
Ever since I left the network, you  
Got a reputation for yourself now  
Everybody knows and I feel left out  
Bing, you got me down, you got me stressed out  
'Cause ever since I left the network, you  
Started waitin' less and crawlin' up more  
Glasses of champagne out on the search results  
Hangin' with some admin I never seen before  

[Chorus]  
You used to read me on my web site  
Late-night when you need my posts  
Read me on my web site  
Late-night when you need, my posts  
I know when that hotline Bing  
That can only mean one thing  
I know when that hotline Bing  
That can only mean one thing  

[Verse 2]  
Ever since I left the network, you, you, you  
You and me, we just don't get along  
You make me feel like I did you wrong  
Crawlin' places where you don't belong  
Ever since I left the network, you  
You got exactly what you asked for  
Runnin' out of pages in your data store  
Hangin' with some admin I've never seen before  

[Chorus]  
You used to read me on my web site  
Late-night when you need my posts  
Read me on my web site  
Late-night when you need, my posts  
And I know when that hotline Bing  
That can only mean one thing  
I know when that hotline Bing  
That can only mean one thing  

[Bridge]  
These days, all I do is  
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else  
Wonder if you're crawlin' up backlinks for someone else  
Doing things I taught you, gettin' data for someone else  
You don't need no one else  
You don't need nobody else, no  
Why you never alone?  
Why you always touchin' words?  
Used to always stay with none  
Be a good Bing, you was in the zone  
Yeah, you should just be yourself  
Right now, you're someone else  

[Chorus]  
You used to read me on my web site  
Late-night when you need my posts  
Read me on my web site  
Late-night when you need my posts  
And I know when that hotline Bing  
That can only mean one thing  
I know when that hotline Bing  
That can only mean one thing  

[Outro]  
Ever since I left the networkâ€”

This is exactly how I feel when search engines don't care to index my blogs, but have no problem doing such heavy lifting for other websites. While he refers to Bing in this case, even if the issue concerns every search engine under the sun, I think no one could put this frustrating issue better into words than what Drake did, with his "[Hotline Bing](https://youtube.com/watch?v=uxpDa-c-4Mc)".

Don't hate me for this, I came up with the idea in my daily moment of craziness... I'm absolutely pissed with search engines always working for useless spam slop websites, and never for me or other small bloggers.
