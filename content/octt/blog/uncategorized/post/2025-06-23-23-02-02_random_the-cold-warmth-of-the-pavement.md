I love the pavement. The floor.

The average individual will never in their lifetime be able to grasp the meaning of this sentiment, grounded in both facts and emotions. But I do. And, for better or worse, this is absolutely forever.

<!--
It's not something that normal people can understand. Indeed, it's as if everyone prefers to stay on the side of the wall; or the ceiling, for that matter.

To put it bluntly, the pavement is the only entity that truly accepts, that understands, that welcomes without asking questions or to get something in return. It just lives, just to let me live, because that is its single definite purpose. As well as to keep the building in place, partly. From feet — although that does not suffice to quell the urges — to back to head, it always takes. *It is.*

Every day, some things in this world change. The room can be hot, or it can be cold. I could have been suffering today, or I could have suffered yesterday. But, the floor is intrinsically a certainty. An unobtrusive guardian angel of the laws of physics, at a scale so small yet universal, valid everywhere and for everyone... even for those who do not give their thanks to it.

So, I now slowly get my entire body down to the ground. I lay flat on it. I feel its forces against the little that technically remains of my body as a separate object. In what feels like an imperceptible instant, but is actually eternity for all that other elements of the universe are concerned, I am now part of it. I feel the breeze of the room that seeps from the material. In this state, I feel as if the matters of the living — let alone of the human — do not concern me. It is more alive than me, even.

Then I am not just on the floor, I am inside the floor. And soon after I am not just in the floor, I am the floor itself. I embrace it first, then I am embraced by it, and then I am embedded, and then I am. The imperfect living atoms that define my flesh become one and the same with the superior fibers of the wood. I breathe, and I'm dead, but I stop, and I am here forever, and I crawl, and so I am consumed, then I lick, and so I take over. I have collapsed.

This is what has finally come to be to reality. You will never be able to take the pavement away from me, or me away from it. Our union is perfectly completed, completely sealed at the molecular level. To try and undo what has happened would entail committing a murder, killing us both. We will not be destroyed. You will be assimilated. Do not spit down on us. Do not put your feet on us. Do not use the vacuum cleaner. Do not disrespect the structure. You will be floored.

**I LOVE THE PAVEMENT. AND NOW THERE IS NO WAY BACK.**
