Recently, StreamingCommunity, which manages arguably one of the biggest cinematographic piracy websites in Italy, sent an interesting post in their Telegram channel. [On the 3rd of June, they wrote about a new project on their hands, called VixSrc](https://t.me/c/1393252619/795):

The nature of what's being presented here might not seem very clear to the average user â€” and, indeed, this is not an announcement for them. Developers of all kinds, instead, are already working at putting to good use what is essentially **the first italian-born Piracy-as-a-Service infrastructure for streaming** (almost) everything audiovisual, from movies to TV series, completely for free and featuring what appears to be a really clean experience for all parties involved. The concept in general is overall pretty new, being tested only by a few other providers in recent years (...with names suspiciously similar to this one, lol), so I'm happy to see it already being pioneered in my country, featuring content in my language.

In more direct terms, VixSrc is a website that just offers web video streams to unlicensed yet high quality copies of movies and TV shows, of various kinds, without all the elements of a normal website (e.g. navigation). Instead, it's intended for developer to integrate the videos in their independent websites or applications, thanks to a provided API. It supports some aesthetic and functional customization, access to the API through custom domains without specialized infrastructure, and in general allows any developer to stream absolute cinema (or total garbage; the choice is theirs) to their users, without a backend and without having to themselves meddle with the actual steps of piracy.

Right now â€” as their single page featuring a presentation, a demo and then some effective documentation shows â€” it provides a web embed API that can be used to load any of the in-catalog videos, in an IFrame or even just on a blank page. It expects an unique item ID from *The Movie Database*, and additionally a season and episode number for series, and returns an HTML5 player for what has been asked. A simple JSON API, consisting of a simple read-only endpoint, is also provided, and that's for getting a list of the catalog (consisting of just a list of TMDB IDs).

While right now the project still seems to be in its early phases, with not much information being available on its inner workings or even its long-term reliability, this is overall pretty cool already. It will be really interesting to see VixSrc grow then, getting a bigger and bigger library â€” especially in terms of eastern content, like anime, where it is currently quite lacking â€” and maybe also have their tech stack become open-source. Also, it's quite curious that this big reveal comes amidst a new great war between StreamingCommunity specifically and italian authorities; could this be a new part of their articulate plan to avoid takeovers and ensure their main business stays working?
